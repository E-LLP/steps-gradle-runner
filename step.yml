        If specified the `gradle` commands will be
        executed with this `gradlew` file, instead of with `gradle` directly;
        for example: `./gradlew assemble` instead of `gradle assemble`.

        **The path should be relative** to the repository root / `workdir`,
        for example: `./gradlew`.

        The step will moves generated apk files that match with this filter
        into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

        This filter is a standerd bash find commands -name pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      description: |
        The step will **not** moves generated apk files that match with this filter
        into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

        You can use this step to avoid moving unalinged or unsigned apk files.

        This filter is a standerd bash find commands negated -name pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

        The step will moves generated mapping files that match with this filter
        into the Bitrise Deploy Directory.

        This filter is a standerd bash find commands -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

        The step will **not** moves generated mapping files that match with this filter

        You can use this step to avoid moving beta mapping file.

        This filter is a standerd bash find commands negated -path pattern, see: http://linux.die.net/man/1/find

      description: |-
        This output will include the path of the generated APK,
        after filtering based on the filter inputs.

        If the build generates more than one APK which fulfills the
        filter inputs this output will contain the last one's path.

      description: |-
        This output will include the path of the generated mapping.txt.

        If more than one mapping.txt exist in project this output will contain the last one's path.
